** This will show how i made this project what i learned and what i'm thinking during this basically it shows steps to acheive the project and my logical thinking **


Day 1-3 

First of all i started with database. Here i'm using neon db (basically postgresql) and Drizzle as ORM to talk my Database 
I'm designing the First my database schema how look like your schema
so, first think about what parts your database will required like id, name , path, createdAt etc and also think about which of the columns you like keep unique and declared it a primary key also make any other column as unique if you required to make it unique . After that define a schema for that to implement this parts to define the schema for Drizzle ORM you can refer the their offical website for Neon Database "https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started/neon-new"

There is index file in db which help you to connect with the database. so, your all importmant links come into the env file and then the index file it will take this from the database.

Day 4 
It is basically it is a next of drizzle to push and generate the database 
In this section we implment the zod validation so, basically zod validation is used to check the data of the our form and validate by itself. 
Basically it is good pratice to validation in the form to sure the correct inputs
